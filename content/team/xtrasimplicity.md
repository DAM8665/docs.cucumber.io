I first started using Cucumber in 2015/2016 after inheriting a complex, monolithic PHP-based application with no automated tests, and have used it in most projects that I've worked on since then.

I started contributing to the cucumber-rails project in early 2018 and actively contribute to Aruba, the Ruby implementation of Cucumber and cucumber-rails where I can.
